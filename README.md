# Personal Curriculum Vitae
Project where I made my personal resume in the form of a web page, hosted with Netlify. I did it since it seems to me a very agile and efficient way to do it, since every change I want to make or every element I want to add will be done in real time, so my resume will always be kept updated for recruiters or people who want to see it, it also has a very organized and very informative structure for visitors.
